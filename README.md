# ChainAI Project

## Overview
ChainAI is a Python module for creating and executing chains of AI tasks. It supports various AI models through the `litellm` backend, including large language models (LLMs). The module provides a structure for organizing and managing multi-step AI workflows.

## Example Usage
Hereâ€™s a brief example of how to use ChainAI:

```python
from chainai import Model, Chain

# Create a model
model = Model(
    model="gpt-4o-mini"
)

# Create a chain
main_chain = (Chain()
    .add("Write a short story about a cat.", key="draft1")
    .add("Make it 10x better.", key="draft2")
    .add("Turn it into a haiku.", key="haiku")
)

# Run the chain
output = main_chain.invoke(model)

# Output the resulting haiku from the final step
print(output.haiku)
```
